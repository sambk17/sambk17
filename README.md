- 👋 Hi, I’m @sambk17
- 👀 My career focus has been in general Data Science, Recommender Systems and ML Platforms
- 🌱 I recently took a variety of Computer Science courses online via Georgia Tech (eDX) & UC San Diego (Coursera).  Courses include Linear Algebra, Intro to Java, Data Structures & Algorithms and Intro to Discrete Mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m also learning about Go ([The Go Programming Language by Donovan & Kernighan](gopl.io)) for 2023
- 🌱 I am currently a Part-Time Computer Science graduate student at both [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home) (Online) and the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/pmp) (Evening Program for Working Professionals)
- 💞️ I’m always down to discuss Recommender Systems (Evaluation Metrics, Knowledge Graphs, etc...) & various Machine Learning Platform topics (e.g. ML Metadata Stores (e.g. MLFlow, neo4j), Feature Stores, Model Serving, etc...)
