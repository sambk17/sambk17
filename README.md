- 👋 Hi, I’m @sambk17
- 👀 My career focus has been in both Recommender Systems and ML Platforms
- 🌱 I recently took a variety of Computer Science courses  online via Georgia Tech (eDX) & UC San Diego (Coursera).  Courses include Linear Algebra, Intro to Java, Data Structures & Algorithms and Intro to Discrete Mathematics.
- 🌱 I’m also learning about Go ([The Go Programming Language by Donovan & Kernighan](gopl.io)) for 2023
- 💞️ I’m always down to discuss Recommender Systems (Evaluation Metrics, Knowledge Graphs, etc...) & various Machine Learning Platform topics (e.g. ML Metadata Stores (e.g. MLFlow, neo4j), Feature Stores, Model Serving, etc...)
- 📫 How to reach me -> @sambk on company Slack or sambk17@hotmail.com
