- 👋 Hi, I’m @sambk17
- 👀 My career focus has been in both Recommender Systems and ML Platforms
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Java (via Duke (Coursera) & Georgia Tech (edX))
- 🌱 I’m also learning about Go ([The Go Programming Language by Donovan & Kernighan](gopl.io))
- 💞️ I’m always down to collaborate on Recommender Systems (Evaluation Metrics, Knowledge Graphs, etc...) & general Machine Learning Platform stuff (e.g. ML Metadata Stores (e.g. MLFlow, neo4j), Feature Stores, etc...)
- 📫 How to reach me -> @sambk on Slack
